0.16 2024-01-08
	- Better document code
	- Catch if somehow our seeds are both zero
	- Log the random seeds used in the unit tests
	- Break all the random methods into their own test file
	- Use two different PCG32 generators to make 64 bit values

0.15 2024-12-11
	- Require Win32::API for Windows builds
	- Update POD documentation with correct bug reporting location
	- Minor perlcritic fixes

0.14 2024-11-28
	- Better documentation of individual functions
	- POD is more consistent with other Perl modules
	- BUGFIX: rand() is no longer inclusive
	- BUGFIX: random_float() uses the full range now (we were off by one)

0.12 2024-11-28
	- Simplify unit testing for ranges
	- Triply verify we are getting enough entropy from the OS
	- Uprgrade/override rand() to use a good PRNG
	- More efficient seeding

0.11 2024-11-19
	- Use grep instead of any because it is more supported
	- Fix some color output
	- Only run 64bit test on 64bit platforms

0.10 2024-11-17
	- Add random_float()
	- Bump the warmup to 1024 iterations because it is fast
	- Much improved unit testing
	- Cleaner XS linking code
	- Properly use CryptGenRandom on Windows
	- Error out if we cannot read /dev/urandom or CryptGenRandom so there is no chance of bad seeds

0.5 2024-11-12
	- Support for older Perls back to v5.12
	- Better support for 32bit Perls
